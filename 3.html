They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with whom they contest the North London derby. Tottenham is owned by ENIC Group, which purchased the club in 2001. The club was estimated to be worth £1.67 billion ($2.3 billion) in 2021, and it was the ninth highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of £390.9 million in 2020.[7][8]</p>
